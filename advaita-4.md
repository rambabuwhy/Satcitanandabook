## ब्रह्म सत्यं जगन्मिथ्या, जीवो ब्रह्मैव नापरः॥

Brahma Satyam Jagannmitya Jivo Brahmaiva Naparah



"Brahman is truth, the world is illusion; the individual self is none other than Brahman."

Here is the breakdown and explanation of each part:

1. ब्रह्म सत्यं (Brahma Satyam): Brahman is truth or reality. "ब्रह्म" (Brahma) refers to the supreme cosmic power or ultimate reality, and "सत्यं" (Satyam) means truth.
2. जगन्मिथ्या (Jagannmitya): The world is an illusion or false. "जगन्" (Jagann) denotes the world or universe, and "मिथ्या" (mitya) indicates falsehood or illusion.
3. जीवो ब्रह्मैव नापरः (Jivo Brahmaiva Naparah): The individual self is none other than Brahman. "जीवो" (Jivo) refers to the individual self or soul, "ब्रह्मैव" (Brahmaiva) means only Brahman, and "नापरः" (Naparah) signifies none other than or not different from.

Overall, this Sanskrit phrase encapsulates the Vedantic philosophy of Advaita (non-dualism), emphasizing the unity of the individual self (Jiva) with the ultimate reality (Brahman). It states that Brahman alone is the ultimate truth, while the world is an illusory manifestation. The phrase asserts the essential non-duality between the individual self and Brahman, implying that the individual self is not separate from Brahman but is essentially identical to it.
