## यथा ह्येकेन मृण्मयेन घटेन नानारूपानि घटाभासानि तथात्मानं नानारूपं पश्यति।

yathā hyēkēna mr̥ṇmayēna ghaṭēna nānārūpāni ghaṭābhāsāni tathā ātmānaṁ nānārūpaṁ nānārūpaṁ



Just as a single clay pot appears as different forms of pots, similarly, one perceives the self as having various forms.

yathā - Just as&#x20;

hyēkēna - through one&#x20;

mr̥ṇmayēna - made of clay&#x20;

ghaṭēna - pot&#x20;

nānārūpāni - various forms&#x20;

ghaṭābhāsāni - appearances of pots&#x20;

tathā - in the same way&#x20;

ātmānaṁ - the Self&#x20;

nānārūpaṁ - in various forms

nānārūpaṁ- perceives

It suggests that just as a single lump of clay can be molded into different pots, the true self (Atman) can take on various temporary forms (physical bodies) in the material world. The underlying essence remains the same, but the external appearances vary. It emphasizes the idea of the eternal and unchanging nature of the self beyond its transient manifestations.

"Those who see the Supreme Lord residing equally in all beings, who see the imperishable amidst the perishable, and who see the self-existent Supreme Lord as the same within everyone, they attain the highest goal and are established in perfect knowledge."
