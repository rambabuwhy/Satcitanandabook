अखण्डमण्डलाकारं (Akhanda-maṇḍalākāram) - Akhanda means "indivisible" or "unbroken," and maṇḍala means "circle" or "sphere." So, Akhanda-maṇḍalākāram refers to something that has an all-pervading or encompassing form.

व्याप्तं (Vyāptam) - Vyāptam means "spread" or "pervaded." It indicates that the aforementioned form is all-encompassing and extends throughout.

येन (Yena) - Yena means "by whom" or "by which." It is used to attribute the characteristics of the previous two words to a specific entity.

चराचरम् (Charācaram) - Chara refers to "moving" or "animate" beings, while acara refers to "non-moving" or "inanimate" objects. So, charācaram signifies the entire universe, including both living and non-living entities.

तत्पदं (Tatpadam) - Tat means "that," and padam means "state" or "condition." Tatpadam refers to the state or condition being described in the previous phrase.

दर्शितं (Darśitam) - Darśitam comes from the verb darś, which means "to show" or "to reveal." Here, it means "that which has been shown" or "that which has been revealed."

येन (Yena) - Same as before, meaning "by whom" or "by which."

तस्मै (Tasmai) - Tasmai is a pronoun that means "to him" or "to that." It refers to the person or entity being honored in this verse.

श्रीगुरवे (Śrīgurave) - Śrī means "auspicious" or "holy," and gurave means "to the guru" or "to the teacher." It is a term of respect used to address a revered teacher or spiritual guide.

नमः (Namaḥ) - Namaḥ means "salutations" or "obeisance." It is an expression of reverence and submission.

So, the overall meaning of the verse can be understood as:

"Salutations to that holy teacher who has revealed the all-pervading and encompassing form, by whom the entire universe of moving and non-moving entities has been shown."
