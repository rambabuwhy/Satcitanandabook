(Kāmaḥ, krodhaḥ, lobhaḥ, mohaḥ, madaḥ, mātsaryaḥ.)

All six vices, namely Kāma, krodha, lobha, moha, mada, and mātsarya, are six Sanskrit words that represent different negative emotions or vices are discussed individually throughout the text in different contexts.

Here are some verses from the Bhagavad Gita that address these vices:

1. Kāma (desire):
   * Bhagavad Gita 3.37: "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with the material mode of passion and later transformed into wrath, and which is the all-devouring, sinful enemy of this world."
2. Krodha (anger):
   * Bhagavad Gita 2.63: "From anger, complete delusion arises, and from delusion, bewilderment of memory. When memory is bewildered, intelligence is lost, and when intelligence is lost, one falls down again into the material pool."
3. Lobha (greed):
   * Bhagavad Gita 16.21: "There are three gates leading to this hell—lust, anger, and greed. Every sane man should give these up, for they lead to the degradation of the soul."
4. Moha (delusion):
   * Bhagavad Gita 16.13: "The demoniac person thinks: 'So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it will increase in the future, more and more. He is my enemy, and I have killed him, and my other enemies will also be killed. I am the lord of everything. I am the enjoyer. I am perfect, powerful, and happy. I am the richest man, surrounded by aristocratic relatives. There is none so powerful and happy as I am. I shall perform sacrifices, I shall give some charity, and thus I shall rejoice.' In this way, such persons are deluded by ignorance."
5. Mada (pride):
   * Bhagavad Gita 16.18: "Puffed up by his false ego, strength, pride, lust, and anger, the demonic person becomes envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in his own body and in the bodies of others, and blasphemes against the real religion."
6. Mātsarya (envy):
   * Bhagavad Gita 16.19: "Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life."
