anda pinda brahmanda

1. Anda: In Sanskrit, "anda" means "egg" or "cosmic egg." It symbolizes the primordial form of the universe, often described as an egg-shaped container that holds the potential for creation.
2. Pinda: "Pinda" refers to a cosmic body or microcosm. In Hindu philosophy, it represents the individual human body or the physical aspect of existence. It signifies the idea that the human body is a miniature replica of the larger universe.
3. Brahmanda: "Brahmanda" combines the words "Brahman" and "anda." "Brahman" is a term used in Hinduism to denote the ultimate reality or the supreme cosmic power. Therefore, "brahmanda" signifies the grand cosmic egg or the entire manifested universe, including both the physical and metaphysical realms.
