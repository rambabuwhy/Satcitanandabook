## सच्चिदानन्द

Satcitananda

1. Sat (सत्) - Truth or Existence: Refers to the eternal and unchanging reality that underlies everything in the universe.
2. Cit (चित्) - Consciousness or Knowledge: Denotes the awareness or consciousness that illuminates all experiences and allows us to perceive and understand the world.
3. Ananda (आनंद) - Bliss or Happiness: Signifies the supreme joy or bliss that arises from the realization of the true nature of reality and the self.

Together, "Satcitananda" represents the idea of an ultimate state of being, where one realizes the oneness of existence, experiences pure consciousness, and transcends all limitations and suffering, attaining a state of absolute bliss and happiness.
